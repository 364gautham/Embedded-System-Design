# Embedded-System-Design

- Development of PCB Layout for 8051 Microcontroller with designing power, reset and oscillator circuitry.

- NVRAM is interfaced to Seimens C501 processor as EEPROM circuit and used memory mapping for program fetch and execution mechanism.

- Debug Latch74LS374 is used to debug firmware by tracing function calls and seen using Logic Analyser.

- Serial Drivers are developed for RS232 communication for AT89C51RC2 microcontroller for In-System Programming. A user application interface is made using serial I/O that shows dynamic memory allocation of buffers.

- Developed Bit Banged I2C drivers and the AT89C51RC2 microcontroller is interfaced to Microchip 24LC16 EEPROM. PCF8574 I2C I/O expander is also implemented.

- Interfaced memory mapped Hitachi LCD HD44780U to AT89C51RC2 by writing drivers for it. A user interface application is made for various functionalities along with clock display. 

Developmental tools used: CodeBlocks IDE with SDCC Compiler, Atmel FLIP, Logic Analyser, Logic port Application, WINCUPL/WINSIM, Oscilloscope, KiCad.
